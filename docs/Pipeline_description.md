# Pipeline Description

## Overview

This document describes the Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline used for the Udagram project. It outlines the stages involved in automatically building, testing, and deploying code changes.

## Pipeline Stages

### Code Commit

- **Developer:** Writes and commits code changes to the GitHub repository.
- **Trigger:** The CI/CD pipeline is triggered upon code commits or pull requests.

### Continuous Integration (CI)

#### Build Stage

- **Purpose:** Compiles and builds the frontend and backend code.
- **Process:**
  - Checkout code from GitHub.
  - Install dependencies using npm.
  - Build the frontend using `npm run build`.
  - Build the backend using `npm run build`.

#### Test Stage

- **Purpose:** Runs automated tests to ensure code quality and functionality.
- **Process:**
  - Execute unit tests and integration tests for both frontend and backend.

### Continuous Deployment (CD)

#### Deploy Stage

- **Purpose:** Deploys the built and tested code to AWS services.
- **Process:**
  - Deploy frontend static files to AWS S3.
  - Deploy backend API to AWS Elastic Beanstalk.
  - Apply any necessary configuration and environment variables.

#### Approval Stage (Optional)

- **Purpose:** Requires manual approval before deploying to the production environment.
- **Process:**
  - A hold step in CircleCI awaits manual approval before proceeding to production deployment.

### Deployment Environments

#### Staging Environment

- **Purpose:** An intermediate environment for final testing before production deployment.
- **Process:**
  - Deployed using the same process as the production environment.
  - Used for user acceptance testing (UAT) and quality assurance (QA).

#### Production Environment

- **Purpose:** The live environment where the application is accessible to end users.
- **Process:**
  - Final deployment after successful testing and approval.
  - Monitored for performance and availability.

## Summary

The CI/CD pipeline for the Udagram project ensures that code changes are automatically built, tested, and deployed, minimizing manual intervention and reducing the risk of errors. It leverages CircleCI for automation and integrates with AWS services for hosting the frontend and backend components.
